### Summary
  1) For Image Classification we used RESNET50 model architecture pre-trained on Imagenet Database (Transfer learning) added our own Dense layers for classification task.

2) For Image segmentation We used RESUNET architecture for better information extraction pixel wise

3) We got overwhelming results
